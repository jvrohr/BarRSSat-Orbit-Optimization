# BarRSSat-Orbit-Optimization
Orbit selection optimization algorithm for a nanosatellite mission for dams level data collection in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil

Requirements and limitations:
- Maximize exposure time to the data collection platforms (DCP) and ground station. Fortunately they are close together.
- Minimize cost of launch.
- Orbit parameters within launcher possible range.
- Minimize debris in Master
- Pass over the ground station at least once a day
- 12 months of minimum lifetime
- Re-enter the atmosphere after the mission lifetime
